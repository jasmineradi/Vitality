This site is for a local massage therapy business that I started up in 2020 before I started school for web development.
I originally started with a web-based website builder and as soon as I was able to learn enough about HTML, CSS and Javascript I was happy to create a small, responsive custom website for my massage practice.
This website is one of my first real website builds and I was able to apply everything I have learned so far.

I'm excited to keep it updated and make changes as I learn more.
